# SCE04

Prototype made for the course of TUD, EWI, CS4235 Socio-Cognitive Engineering.

Group 4. Haoran Wang, Manolo Xin, Mathieu Jung-Muller, Pierre Bongrand, Pietro Piccini, Sneha Lodha.

For questions on the code, please contact Mathieu Jung-Muller (mathieu.jung-muller@student.tudelft.nl).

This code is adapted for the Choregraphe framework and for a Pepper robot. It may not work if you want to open it on other platforms or using different software.



There are four behaviours implemented.
For a more extensive explanation on them, please check out our XWiki written for this course: https://xwiki.ewi.tudelft.nl/xwiki/wiki/sce2022group04/view/Prototype/.

Gardening Activity:
This is the behaviour used for our evaluation.

Paperplane Activity:
This is the behaviour used for our first presentation. It was the first step towards a more complete activity. Gardening Activity behaviour is built on Paperplane Activity with many improvements.

Meal Reminder:
This behaviour has meal time hard-coded. It tells the person when it is time to eat, and engages in a very short and basic conversation with them.

Medication Reminder:
This behaviour has medication time hard-coded, as well as which medication should be taken at what time. It tells the person when it is time to take specific medicine, and engages in a very short ans basic conversation with them.
